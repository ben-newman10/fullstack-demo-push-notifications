# DEMO 1: OF BASIC WEBSOCKET USE

# Does NOT use "push" notifications from Elastic
# But it DOES use them between the middleware and the UI, over WebSockets
#
# there will a subsequent demo for each of the following changes:
### DEMO 2: Using Elastic push instead of polling
### DEMO 3: Using RabbitMQ instead of Websockets (to push updates to the UI)
#
### these are mainly middleware changes, but several UI improvements were also made (as it evolved over time)

# What is being demonstrated here:
### generating system metrics using metricbeat (which stores them in Elastic)
### Python middleware pulling the metrics from Elastic (for "subscribed" channels only)
### Python middleware pushing the metrics into the UI via a WebSocket
### UI displaying the metrics
### UI sending signals (via the WebSocket to the middleware) to toggle channel subscriptions on/off

# start the UI:
    npm run dev

# there is a widget per channel (each type of system metrics available) a "subscribe" button and an area to display the metrics
# each widget is independent of the others and has its own channel, uses a WebSocket to talk to the middleware
# look in the dev tools - Network/Console - see how all WS have failed (because there is no MW running)
# start the middleware:
    cd src; uvicorn main:app

# refresh the UI - now see how the WS connections have succeeded
# in the UI try to "Subscribe" - nothing happens
# check the Python console output - subscriptions fail unless Elastic is running
# start Elastic:
    docker run --memory=1gb --name es01-test --net elastic -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.15.2

# in the UI try to "Subscribe" - nothing happens again
# check the Python console output - subscriptions fail unless Elastic contains the Metrics index
# this doesn't exist, because the Metrics Producer isn't running yet

# prepare to start the MP
### first start Kibana
    docker run --memory=1gb --name kib01-test --net elastic -p 5601:5601 -e "ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS=http://es01-test:9200" docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:7.15.2
### then setup the Metrics index
    docker run --net elastic docker.elastic.co/beats/metricbeat:7.15.2 setup -E setup.kibana.host=kib01-test:5601 -E output.elasticsearch.hosts=["http://es01-test:9200"]

### start the MP (metricbeat) 
    docker run --name=metricbeat --user=root  --volume="/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro" --volume="/sys/fs/cgroup:/hostfs/sys/fs/cgroup:ro" --volume="/proc:/hostfs/proc:ro" --volume="/:/hostfs:ro" docker.elastic.co/beats/metricbeat:7.15.2 metricbeat -e -E output.elasticsearch.hosts=["192.168.1.145:9200"]

# in the UI try to "Subscribe" - now it works






















demo for use of WebSockets 
the idea is to allow push notifications to be sent from Elastic to the middleware (Python: FastAPI) and then on up to the UI (JavaScript: Svelte), in order to avoid the UI having to constantly poll the middleware which then has to constantly poll Elastic in response (or perform some kind of caching)

progress so far:
* UI opens a WS to the middleware, and subscribes to messages coming from it
* UI sends a boolean down the WS to the middle to toggle on/off its behaviour WRT polling Elastic
* Elastic is running with MetricBeats, so the index is being populated with system stats
* UI contains logic to determine when the backend status has changed (ie. when received message has different data to before)
* have multiple parallel independent components in the UI (each driven by their own backend data)
* remove the logic (to determine when the backend status has changed) from the UI
* put this logic in the middleware instead
* installed an Elastic plugin which pushes change notifications out on a websocket - requires Elastic and Kibana 6.5.3, so installed them also (instead of latest version 7.15.1) 
* have to install the plugin into Elastic (and then restart Elastic) which can't be done easily with Elastic running inside a Docker container (so not using Docker now)

TODO
    configure the plugin to push the appropriate updates out to the WS
    change the Python code to use the Elastic WS instead of polling it



to start the UI:
    npm run dev

to start Python server:
    cd src; uvicorn main:app


to install *** VERSION: 6.5.3 *** of Elastic, Kibana, Metricbeat
    echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee â€“a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-6.x.list
    apt update
    apt install elasticsearch=6.5.3
    apt install kibana=6.5.3
    cd /tmp
    wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/metricbeat/metricbeat-6.5.3-amd64.deb
    dpkg -i /tmp/metricbeat-6.5.3-amd64.deb


to install the plugin
    git clone https://github.com/ForgeRock/es-change-feed-plugin.git
    cd es-change-feed-plugin
    mvn clean install  
    mkdir /tmp/elasticsearch
    cp target/es-changes-feed-plugin.zip /tmp/elasticsearch
    cd /tmp/elasticsearch
    unzip es-changes-feed-plugin.zip 
    cd ..
    zip -r es-changes-feed-plugin.zip elasticsearch
    # requires Elastic to be running first
    /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install file:///tmp/es-changes-feed-plugin.zip
    systemctl restart elastic 


to run the demo:
    
    start Python server:
        cd src; uvicorn main:app

    start the UI:
        npm run dev

    start Elastic:
        systemctl start elastic

    start Kibana:
        # requires Elastic to be running first
        systemctl start kibana

    start  Metricbeat:
        # requires Elastic and Kibana to be running first
        /usr/bin/metricbeat setup -e
        systemctl start metricbeat
