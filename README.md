demo for use of WebSockets 
the idea is to allow push notifications to be sent from Elastic to the middleware (Python: FastAPI) and then on up to the UI (JavaScript: Svelte), in order to avoid the UI having to constantly poll the middleware which then has to constantly poll Elastic in response (or perform some kind of caching)

progress so far:
* UI opens a WS to the middleware, and subscribes to messages coming from it
* UI sends a boolean down the WS to the middle to toggle on/off its behaviour WRT polling Elastic
* Elastic is running with MetricBeats, so the index is being populated with system stats
* UI contains logic to determine when the backend status has changed (ie. when received message has different data to before)
* have multiple parallel independent components in the UI (each driven by their own backend data)
* remove the logic (to determine when the backend status has changed) from the UI
* put this logic in the middleware instead
* installed an Elastic plugin which pushes change notifications out on a websocket - requires Elastic and Kibana 6.5.3, so installed them also (instead of latest version 7.15.1) 
* have to install the plugin into Elastic (and then restart Elastic) which can't be done easily with Elastic running inside a Docker container (so not using Docker now)

TODO
    configure the plugin to push the appropriate updates out to the WS
    change the Python code to use the Elastic WS instead of polling it



to start the UI:
    npm run dev

to start Python server:
    cd src; uvicorn main:app


to install *** VERSION: 6.5.3 *** of Elastic, Kibana, Metricbeat
    echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee â€“a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-6.x.list
    apt update
    apt install elasticsearch=6.5.3
    apt install kibana=6.5.3
    cd /tmp
    wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/metricbeat/metricbeat-6.5.3-amd64.deb
    dpkg -i /tmp/metricbeat-6.5.3-amd64.deb


to install the plugin
    git clone https://github.com/ForgeRock/es-change-feed-plugin.git
    cd es-change-feed-plugin
    mvn clean install  
    mkdir /tmp/elasticsearch
    cp target/es-changes-feed-plugin.zip /tmp/elasticsearch
    cd /tmp/elasticsearch
    unzip es-changes-feed-plugin.zip 
    cd ..
    zip -r es-changes-feed-plugin.zip elasticsearch
    # requires Elastic to be running first
    /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install file:///tmp/es-changes-feed-plugin.zip
    systemctl restart elastic 


to run the demo:
    
    start Python server:
        cd src; uvicorn main:app

    start the UI:
        npm run dev

    start Elastic:
        systemctl start elastic

    start Kibana:
        # requires Elastic to be running first
        systemctl start kibana

    start  Metricbeat:
        # requires Elastic and Kibana to be running first
        /usr/bin/metricbeat setup -e
        systemctl start metricbeat
